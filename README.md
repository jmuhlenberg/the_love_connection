# the_love_connection
General Assembly SEIR Unit 03 Group Project

####By: Jim Petersen, Daniel Della-Rose, & John Muhlenberg


## Project Details & Information

  This project entailed working with a group to create a full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application using the MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. We implemented two models (Users and Likes) and related these to each other in a one-to-one relationship. This project's database was hosted on Mongo Atlas and deployed online via Heroku.

  To organize the data we wrote a user story, created wireframes, and used Trello to track tasks. We implemented the Materialize CSS framework to stylize the site.

####Use:
  Upon reaching the site's main page, you are greeted with two choices - to sign up or log in. If you attempt to log in with an incorrect User ID you will not be able to log in and see your matches. After filling out all the forms to sign up and submitting, you now have the ability to log in using your unique User ID. Logging in will display all of your matches and give you the option to edit your user profile.


##The Challenges

  One of the biggest challenges we had not faced yet was working in a group on a larger project. We worked collaboratively to avoid working in the same files, notified each other of which piece we were working on, and played off of each other's strengths. When one got roadblocked by an error we worked together to resolve the issue.

  Some of the technical challenges we faced were posting and putting the information in a properly formatted way to the database so that the two models (Users and Likes) would be related. The next challenge was figuring out how to compare the likes of the Logged In user to everyone else in the database.


##Areas of Improvement

  We would have liked to add a rating system in which users were rated based on the likes that matched.

  Improving the user experience so that when you are logged in, you can continue to edit your profile and view matches until you log out.

  Another wish list item would have been to add a CSS framework. We attempted using Materialize and Material UI, but were unsuccessful implementing.
