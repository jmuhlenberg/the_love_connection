Daniel Will Describe the website and do a brief crud demo….

Describe the website:

The love connection is a “basic” dating website where a user can create a profile, view the profile and delete the profile.  Additionally, the website matches your “romantic” preferences against all other members in the database and presents a list of users who match all of your preferences.   

For example,

I’ll create Margo

(What you put in for margo is mostly unimportant.  Her userid should be margot722 and her image should be :

    ./images/margot722.jpeg   

Margot’s preferences do matter.  

Age: 26-35.  
Height: tall.
Gender:Male
Build: stocky
EyeColor : brown
HairColor:  red

Now…. Enter     margot722 as a userid …. This will give her a couple of matches

Update Margot with the exact same information except change the eye color to blue and she will get a different set of matches

Then delete her and try and log back in and that should be the end of demonstrating CRUD.  If someone wants you to change data elements then politely explain that our sample data is stylized to show functionality and random hits would be rare.  (If pressed the math is…There are six attributes with at least 2 options a piece.  The odds of randomly hitting someone would be 1/2 raised to the 6th power or about 1 try in 75 attempts would yield a match - so back off it aint happening)
